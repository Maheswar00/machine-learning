# machine-learning
Classification and regression Machine learning algorithms have been implemented on few datasets using R studios


In the attached Zip file you can find 3 different datasets.



1. Signal prediction.   ---------       logistic and Support vector machine.    
2. Bike sharing prediction.------       Linear, Lasso which also includes Ridge regression.
3. Fuel consumption prediction.--       linear and random forest regression.

this algorithms includes data cleaning as well.
